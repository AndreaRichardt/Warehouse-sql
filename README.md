# SQL Server Data Warehouse Project â€” Medallion Architecture

Welcome to my data warehouse project. This repository showcases my understanding of modern data architecture using **SQL Server** and the **Medallion architecture** (bronze, silver, and gold layers). The project is based on **mock data** designed to simulate real-world business scenarios and demonstrates best practices in data modeling, ETL processes, and warehouse documentation.

---

## Project Overview

This data warehouse project applies the **Medallion architecture**, a layered approach to organizing data pipelines for scalability, quality, and clarity. It consists of:

- **Bronze Layer:** Raw data ingestion, minimal transformation
- **Silver Layer:** Cleaned, deduplicated, and structured data
- **Gold Layer:** Aggregated and business-ready datasets for analytics

This structure helps ensure transparency, modularity, and reusability across the pipeline.

## Tech Stack

- **SQL Server** â€“ Primary database and ETL engine
- **T-SQL** â€“ Data transformation and querying
- **SSMS** â€“ Development environment
- **Excel / CSV** â€“ Input mock datasets
- **Markdown** â€“ Documentation

## Notes

> This is a **mock project** created solely for educational and portfolio purposes. While the data and scenarios are fictional, the technical structure reflects real-world data warehouse principles.
